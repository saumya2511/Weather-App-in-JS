# Weather-App-in-JS
 I have build a weather app in HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript. In this app, we can get to see the weather details of a particular city by entering the city name. One can also get their current location weather details by clicking on the "Get Device Location" button. We'll get to see many weather details including temperature in celsius, weather conditions, location, feels like, and humidity. With this project, I have hone the concepts of fetching API's and Frond-End Development.
